    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>6 heaping cups broccoli florets</li>
        <li>1 10.6 ounce can cream of mushroom soup</li>
        <li>1/2 cup sour cream</li>
        <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
        <li>1/4 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon parsley flakes</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>2 1/2 cups shredded cheddar cheese, divided</li>
        <li>1 sleeve Ritz crackers, crushed</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F.</li>
        <li>Cook the broccoli just until it turns a bright green in color - you can boil or steam the broccoli, but it should take just a few minutes - you do not want the broccoli cooking all the way through. Drain, rinse with cold water, and squeeze all excess water from the broccoli with a dishtowel.</li>
        <li>Stir together soup, sour cream, egg, cream, herbs and spices, and 2 cups of the cheese.</li>
        <li>Mix in broccoli.</li>
        <li>Spread the mixture into a buttered 9x9 square baking dish.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the remaining 1/2 cup of cheddar cheese over the top.</li>
        <li>Layer the crushed crackers over the cheese.</li>
        <li>Drizzle the melted butter over the crackers, covering as much area as you can.</li>
        <li>Bake the casserole for approximately 30-35 minutes, until the casserole is bubbling and golden brown across the top - you may need to cover the casserole with aluminum foil after the first 20 minutes so that it does not brown too much.
        </li>
    </ol>
